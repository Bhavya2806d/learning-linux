Introduction to File Permissions
Linux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file and directory has three levels of permission:

Owner (User): The creator of the file.
Group: Users belonging to the assigned group.
Others: All other users on the system.
Permissions are represented as:

Read (r or 4) – View file contents.
Write (w or 2) – Modify file contents.
Execute (x or 1) – Run scripts or programs.

ls -l filename
chmod u+x filename  # Add execute for user
chmod g-w filename  # Remove write for group
chmod o=r filename  # Set read-only for others
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= filename  # Set full access for user, read/execute for group, and no access for others
  
chmod 755 filename  # User (rwx), Group (r-x), Others (r-x)
chmod 644 filename  # User (rw-), Group (r--), Others (r--)
chmod 700 filename  # User (rwx), No access for others
  
chown newuser filename  
chown newuser:newgroup filename
chown :newgroup filename

chgrp newgroup filename
chgrp -r newgroup dirname
  
SetUID (s on user execute bit)
Allows users to run a file with the file owner's permissions.
chmod u+s filename 

SetGID (s on group execute bit)
Files: Users run the file with the group's permissions. Directories: Files created inside inherit the group.
chmod g+s filename  # Set on file
chmod g+s directory/  # Set on directory 

Sticky Bit (t on others execute bit)
Used on directories to allow only the owner to delete their files.
chmod +t directory/  

umask defines default permissions for new files and directories. Check current umask:
umask
Set a new umask:
umask 022  # Default: 755 for directories, 644 for files
