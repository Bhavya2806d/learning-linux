User Management in Linux
Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning multiple users can operate on a system simultaneously. Proper user management ensures security, controlled access, and system integrity.

  Key files involved in user management:
/etc/passwd – Stores user account details.
/etc/shadow – Stores encrypted user passwords.
/etc/group – Stores group information.
/etc/gshadow – Stores secure group details.
